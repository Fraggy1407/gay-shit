EVTDESC2000000057;Ever since the early 1700s Germans from mainly Lorraine have been settling in the areas of Banat and Vojvodina. When Germany recently unified with the Austrian Empire the Region was left to Hungary without any guarantee for protection of the German minorities and their culture. A grave mistake which lead to a series of conferences and negotiations about the status of those settlers. The most recent one of those concluded in the formation of the Freistaat Banat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
